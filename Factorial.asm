It looks like the assembly code provided has several issues with syntax and instructions. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code that calculates the factorial of 3. This code assumes you're using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) syntax.

```asm
ORG 100h

DATA SEGMENT
    N DB 3        ; Number to calculate factorial for
    SUM DW 1      ; Initialize SUM to 1 (for multiplication purposes)
DATA ENDS

CODE SEGMENT
MAIN PROC
    MOV AX, DATA  ; Load DATA segment into AX
    MOV DS, AX    ; Move AX to DS to point to DATA segment

    MOV CX, N     ; Load N (3) into CX
    MOV AX, 1     ; Initialize AX to 1 (accumulator for factorial)

FactorialLoop:
    MUL CX        ; Multiply AX by CX
    LOOP FactorialLoop   ; Decrement CX and loop until CX = 0

    MOV SUM, AX   ; Store the result in SUM

    MOV AX, 4C00h ; Exit program
    INT 21h
MAIN ENDP
CODE ENDS
END MAIN
```

### Explanation
- `N` is set to `3`, so the program will calculate `3!`.
- `SUM` is initialized to `1` and will hold the final result.
- `MOV CX, N` loads `3` into the `CX` register.
- `FactorialLoop` multiplies `AX` by `CX`, then decrements `CX` with `LOOP` until `CX` reaches `0`.
- `MOV SUM, AX` stores the factorial result in `SUM`.
- `MOV AX, 4C00h` and `INT 21h` are DOS interrupt instructions to exit the program. 

This code will give you the factorial of `3`, which is `6`.
